    <h4>Self Closing Tags</h4>
    <p>
        A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag, 
        which means it does not have a separate closing tag as < /tag >. 
    </p>
    <h4>Meta Tags</h4>
    <p>
        The < meta > tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

        < meta> tags always go inside the < head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

        Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
