                    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to 
                    be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often 
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as 
                    JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and 
                    render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page 
                    semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what 
                    you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make 
                    content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with 
                    background images and colors? What is CSS? Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not
                    a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style
                    HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red

                    JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with 
                    first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many 
                    non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. 
                    JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting 
                    object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
